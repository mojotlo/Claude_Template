# CLAUDE.md

This is an AI-assisted JavaScript/TypeScript/Node.js project.

Read the following files before doing any work, in this order:

1. `ai/system-invariants.md` — rules that must never be violated
2. `ai/agent-bootstrap.md` — working process and task workflow
3. `ai/ai-guide.md` — architecture, layers, and dev strategy
4. `ai/repo-map.md` — where to find things in this repository
5. `ai/allowed-changes.md` — what you are and are not allowed to do

## Quick Reference

### Commands
```bash
npm run dev        # start development server
npm test           # run test suite
npm run build      # production build
npm run lint       # lint check
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript type check
```

> Update these commands to match this project's actual package.json scripts.

### Stack
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Package manager:** [npm / pnpm / yarn — fill in]
- **Test framework:** [Jest / Vitest / etc — fill in]

### Key Rules (full details in ai/ files)
- Tests must pass after every change
- Never modify `node_modules/`, lock files, or deployment config without explicit instruction
- Keep files under 300 lines; 500 is the hard maximum
- Follow existing patterns — consistency over novelty
- When in doubt, stop and ask

## Session Workflow

Every feature or fix follows this loop. Do not skip steps.

```
Plan mode        → agree on spec and approach before writing any code
Code mode        → execute the spec; loop until all tests pass
/simplify        → clean up code without changing behavior (only on green tests)
/verify          → start dev server, open browser, confirm app works end to end
/code-review     → catch anything missed; flag must-fix issues before committing
/commit-push-pr  → commit, push branch, open PR with description
```

### Rules for this loop
- Each spec should be small enough to complete in one session — split if unsure
- Never run /simplify on failing tests
- /verify may surface issues that send you back to code mode — that is expected
- /code-review is a first pass, not a substitute for reading the diff yourself
- The PR is the final human gate — review before merging
- GitHub Actions will run CI automatically on the PR (lint, typecheck, tests, Claude review)
